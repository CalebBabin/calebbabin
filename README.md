## Software Engineer | Tinkerer | WebGPU enthusiast
### Building beautiful and broadly accessible experiences.

I have the most experience building for the web in JS/HTML/CSS, and got hooked on React for UIs a few years ago. I've loved building novel experiences in WebGL and am super excited for the new tooling specifically around WebGPU as it rolls out.

And is it just me or is practically anything built with WebSockets super fun? Servers are the bridges between users on the internet, and internet protocol is the wind pushing us across!
