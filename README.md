## Software Engineer | Tinkerer | WebGPU enthusiast
### Building beautiful and broadly accessible experiences.

I have the most experience building for the web in JS/HTML/CSS, and got hooked on React for UIs a few years ago. I've loved building novel experiences in WebGL and am super excited for the new tooling specifically around WebGPU as it rolls out.
